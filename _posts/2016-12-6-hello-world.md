Hello World, our own website is here!

we're proud to finally put our games into the spotlight, although not everything is finished yet! As time goes by, each 
game will get its own individual page with more than just some screenshots to show.

But for the time being, we will use our blog to communicate more about game design, video game Art and programming!

We will let you know about our game released and updates on this site and Twitter, so be sure to subscribe if you like what
we are doing!
