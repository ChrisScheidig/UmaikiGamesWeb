Zirkonia is a classic turn-based tactical RPG (like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics),
which is influenced largely by visual novels. Itâ€™s settled in a dystrophic world, a few centuries before its
final doom. Borderlands of the know continent, which are constantly attacked by an ancient power since the
beginning of history, are giving in more and more. Whole countries are breaking away gradually and disappear
in the dark gap - an area that borders the whole land and devours it bit by bit.
