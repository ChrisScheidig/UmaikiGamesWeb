Zirkonia is a classic turn-based tactical RPG (like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics),
which is influenced largely by old dark and classic fantasy works like Berserk and Record of Lodoss war.
</p>

</p>
Zirkonias dystopic world is settled a few centuries before its final doom - The borderland of the known 
continent, under constant attack by an ancient power since the beginning of history, are collapsing more and more.
Whole countries are breaking away gradually and disappear into the dark gap, an area that borders the whole land
and devours it.

<p>
In this dying world, the young mercenary girl Kyara sets out for her first mission: Not to save the world, but to
capture and abduct the only person who may turn around this cruel fate.
