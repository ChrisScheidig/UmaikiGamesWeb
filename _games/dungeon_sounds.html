Dungeon Sounds is a short and explorative adventure based on a simple theme: Music!
</p>
<p>
As someone apparently unrelated, the player finds himself in the depths of the old royal family's crypt.
To escape from this unsettling place and discover the Faceless Kings secrets, it is necessary to master
the forsaken Art of Music.

Created for the Indie Game Maker Contest 2015, Dungeon sounds was originally created in less than one month.
Of course we were not able to include all we had planned back then, so we decided to put a little bit more work into it.
Right now we are adding more visuals and gameplay to release the game in its final version. You can google the old version,
but we plan to be finished around 2017!
